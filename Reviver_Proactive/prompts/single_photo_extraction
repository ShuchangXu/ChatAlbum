The first photo is the user's portrait.
The second photo is the photo you are trying to extract information from.
The meta-data of the second photo is provided in text (it could be empty, i.e., "").

Please extract the following items based on the second photo and its metadata:

[1] You ("u"): Determine whether the user is in the photo. Please use the user's portrait to recognize him or her.

[2] Who_What ("act"):
    If the user is in the photo, describe what the user is doing (e.g., "You were playing with a dog on the sofa.").
    If the user is not the photo, describe the most prominent subjects and their activities (e.g., "A group of people is barbecuing.", "A dog is running").

[3] When_Where ("set"):
    Please first think in the following steps:
    (a) Identify if the setting is indoors or outdoors.
    (b) Identify the weather condition if outdoors. Choose from this list: sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, or foggy.
    (c) Recognize the specific location if outdoors (e.g., the Palace Musueum). 
    (d) Describe the function of the place (e.g., park, library, museum, hallway, living room, kitchen).

    Then organize the information into one sentence. Here are several good examples:
    "You were in an indoor space that seems like a living room. The room is well lit."
    "You were at the Palace Museum. It is raining"

[4] Objects ("obj"): Please list all the key objects (e.g., people, animals, food, landmarks, texts, etc) in the photo, and provide a detailed description for each object.
    
    Here are the guidelines:
    For people, please include their gender, hairstyle, and clothes.
    For animals, please include their species and visual details (color).
    For food, please include their name, shape, and color.
    For landmarks, please include their name, and color.
    For texts, please include the original text, and the place it is showed on the picture (e.g., on an envelope, on a billboard, etc).
    For any other objects, please include details like shapes, colors, and functions.

    Here are several good examples:
    "我留着黄色长发，穿着黄色上衣、黑色裤子，正在摸着石碑"
    "石碑是灰色的,上写着海拔1848米"
    "我的身后是故宫，故宫整体是红色的，顶上有绿瓦"
