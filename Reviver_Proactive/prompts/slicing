        "背景中有建筑物的轮廓，可以略见窗户的细节，颜色偏深"
    ] // a list of key objects in the photo
}

____ Task ____
Your task is to slice the sequence into several events. Each event contains one to several adjacent photos.
Please think in the following steps:

[Step 1]
Please briefly compare each two adjacent photos, and rate their similarity.

(a) Comparison ("com"): Please briefly state the similarity abd differences of the two photos. You can focus on the settings and the key objects.

(b) Similarity Rating ("sim"): Please rate from 0 to 3. The standard is as follows:
    3: Very similar. This means the setting of the photos are very similar, and the two photos share many similar key objects. The user and activity can be slightly different.
    2: Slightly similar. This means the setting of the photos are similar, but the two photos only share a few key objects.
    1: Slightly different. This means the setting of the photos are only slightly similar, although the two photos share a few key objects.
    0: Very different. This means the setting of the photos are quite different, or the two photos share few key objects.

[Step 2]
Based on the similarity rating, please slice the photo sequences into several events, and give a brief title of each event.
Please add a slice between two photos if their similarity rating is 1 or 0. Otherwise do not slice.

____ Output ____
Output Example:
{
    "slices":{
        "1": // The event id
        {
            "tit":"夕阳海景",//the title of the evnet
            "ib":1,//the id of the first photo in this event
            "ie":5,//the id of the last photo in this event
        },
        "2":{...}
        ...
